# Euclidean-Vector-library
Attempting to implement a Euclidean Vector in Python using OOP principles.

## Specs
### Constructors

#### 1) Default Constructor - Generate a euclidean vector w/ dimension 1 and magnitude 0.0
#### 2) Single-argument constructor - Takes number of dimensions as a parameter, but sets all mag to 0.0.
#### 3) Double-argument constructor - Takes number of dimensions and magnitude as parameters.
#### 4) Iterator constructor - Pass an iterable item (list, dictionary) and the library should work out required dimensions and magnitudes according to the iterated values.
